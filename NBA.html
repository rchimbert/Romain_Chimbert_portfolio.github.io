								<h2>Project overview</h2>
								<span class="image fit"><img src="images/tableau NBA overview.png" alt="" /></span>
								This end-to-end project consists in gathering some statistics <b>by nba franchises</b> such as the all-time top 5 scorer, the top 5 rebounders, 
								the number of championships won by the franchise, or their three point shooting throughout the ages on an interactive dashboard. One of the main 
								difficulty is that <b>some franchises have change names several times during their history</b>, so we have to group those statistics under the same franchise code.
								<hr />
								<h2>Data gathering, cleaning and exporting to csv file with python</h2>
									First, I gathered some data of players attribute and player statistics by seasons from 1950 to 2017 thanks to
									a Kaggle dataset available online (<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/drgilermo/nba-players-stats?select=player_data.csv">The dataset</a>, I used the season_stat.csv and player_data.csv). Then, I gathered some more datas from a website gathering every NBA champions.
									I then <b>cleaned and processed the data</b> in order to make further SQL request then. This step is detailed on this code 
									available on my Github: <a href="https://github.com/rchimbert/NBA_statistics-/blob/main/data_cleaning.ipynb">The code</a>.</p>
									<hr />
										<h2>Creation of SQL table and filling them with the data rows</h2>
										I first created the structures of the table used for the SQL request and made few modifications of some tables element directly on SQL. Then, I created another table 
										to gather every NBA franchises former name(s) in order to <b>count the number of championship won by the franchise</b> and some all-time statistics such as the best scorers. 
										This step is detailed on this code 
									available on my Github: <a href="https://github.com/rchimbert/NBA_statistics-/blob/main/Create%20Table.pgsql">The code</a>.</p>
									Finally, in order to fill those tables created with all the rows available very quickly, I just run these lines of code on the <b>postgreSQL
									shell</b>.

									<hr />
									<h2>SQL queries in order to fill the Tableau Dashboard with statistics</h2>
									To get some more insight about this seasons statistics dataset by player, I created several <b>SQL queries on postgreSQL</b> to be shown then in a Tableau Dashboard.
									This step is detailed on this code 
									available on my Github: <a href="https://github.com/rchimbert/NBA_statistics-/blob/main/Select%20Query.pgsql">The code</a>.</p>
									<hr />
									<h2>Tableau dashboard visual</h2>
									Finally, I was able to create a visual available on my Tableau Public profile. On this dashboard, we can <b>select an NBA franchise at the top left corner</b>, and it displays the top 5 all-time scorer, rebounder, passer, blocker by franchise and the number of championships won. 
									Every player attributes (height and weight) are visible <b>by dragging the mouse on their name</b>. 
									This interactive visual is available here on my Tableau Public profile (<b>note: if you are on laptop think about ticking the option of displaying the dashboard as on a desktop at the bottom</b>): <a href="https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/romain.chimbert/viz/NBAdashboard_16927290271030/Dashboard_nba">The dashboard</a>.</p>
